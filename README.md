##  Software Structure

### PS/2 Keyboard Interface
- Reads **scan codes** (MAKE + BREAK codes) from keyboard  
- Converts scan codes → ASCII → LCD output  
- Serial protocol: 1 start, 8 data bits, 1 parity, 1 stop  

### NRF24L01+ RF Module
- Air data rates: **250 kbps / 1 Mbps / 2 Mbps**  
- 2.4 GHz RF channel, ultra-low power  
- SPI communication, packet-based protocol  

### Flow
1. Initialize system & peripherals  
2. Welcome message → user selects **Chat**, **Battery**, or **Clock**  
3. Handle key presses (via ASCII conversion)  
   - `1` → Chat  
   - `2` → Battery loop  
   - `3` → Clock loop  

### Clock Loop
- Maintains and displays **HH:MM:SS**  
- Updates every second  
- Option to exit with **ESC**  

### Battery Loop
- Reads battery voltage via ADC  
- Displays voltage + % on LCD  
- Updates periodically
